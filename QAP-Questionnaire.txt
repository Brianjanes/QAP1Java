1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep 
track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this 
assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.) 

~ 2 hours, I was very confused about the package creation because of my file structure.
 
2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.) 
 
I ended up calling a friend who is a Java Developer and he helped me understand packages and importing and even a little bit about intellij vs VSCode for Java Development.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention 
name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.) 

See above - I didn't necessarily end up needing any help with the logic of the exercises but just needed a larger understanding of the language and it's nuances.
 
4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did 
you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)? 

No I didn't end up needing to ask any questions to any instructors.
 
5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and 
whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring 
some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

The quesitons are perfectly fine - as usual i find it a bit tricky to decipher exactly what you are asking. I think spending some time in different IDEs and talking about little nuances like how folder names can't contain any special characters if you intend to use them as a package or something like that could be valuable because this isn't always super intuitive and I spent a good bit of time trying to understand what was going on.
